ick comes with [discount](http://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Code/discount/)
Markdown processor. It's turned off by default.

You can compile ick with Markdown support using the following command:

	$ MARKDOWN=1 make
	
To use Markdown in your content files, declare `markup`:

	=markup markdown
	
(Actually, this document is formatted with it.)
