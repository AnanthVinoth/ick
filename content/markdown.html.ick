ick comes with [discount](http://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Code/discount/)
Markdown processor. It's now turned on by default.

First, compile discount:

        $ cd discount
        $ ./configure
        $ make

Then compile ick:

	$ MARKDOWN=1 make
	
To use Markdown in your content files, declare `markup`:

	=markup markdown
	
(Actually, this document is formatted with it.)
